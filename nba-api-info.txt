Scoreboard, Summary are available live
playergamelog updated periodically but not live (at half, and likely quarter end) 

The others are only updated after game

endpoints:

Scoreboard (now has access restrictions, perhaps looks at origin so using different endpoint)
parameters:
1. Date
2. LeagueID (default and should set at 00)
3. DayOffset (use 0)

example
http://stats.nba.com/stats/scoreboard?GameDate=12/23/2017&LeagueID=00&DayOffset=0

contains
GameHeader resultSets[0].rowSet[game]   basic game info
LineScore resultSets[1]                 pts, wins losses, basic team stat ast fg reb etc *read warning&
SeriesStandings resultSets[2]           series stats between home/away teams
LastMeeting resultSets[3]               team cities and names, last meeting
EastConfStandingsByDay resultSets[4]    all east teams win loss, home and road record
WestConfStandingsByDay resultSets[5]
Available resultSets[6]                 game id + "PT_AVAILABLE", not sure what stands for

**Warning** LineScore order of teams in future games is sometimes mixed up (typically home-away flip, occasionally all teams scrambled), not sure if because of errors in automation on nba server side? Supposed to be visitor then home to reflect the GameHeader, but inconsistently and erroneously shows home then away team sometimes. Compare to GameHeader and LastMeeting which are consistently in correct corresponding order. Might need function to verify correct team? UPDATE: seems like they correct the values on day of game, but keep in mind might show teams mixed up on games not yet played

*Note: LastMeeting is not always in same order as GameHeader

"GameID is required"
parameters:
GameID (find through scoreboard)
extra: if use &StartPeriod=0&EndPeriod=0&StartRange=0&EndRange=0 after GameID
then it will show extra Table9 featuring basic player stats like season avg, not sure if intended? Update: Seems like after game ends Table9 is eventually added without need for the extra parameters 
Update 2: appears to be inconsistent, sometimes will appear if adding RangeType, try changing around parameters if desired 
e.g. https://stats.nba.com/stats/boxscoresummaryv2?GameID=0021700494&StartPeriod=0&EndPeriod=0&StartRange=0&EndRange=0

Today
https://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v3/today.json

shows json available, endpoints for today's games

box scores in stats.nba/com appear to get the live scores from
https://data.nba.com/data/10s/v2015/json/mobile_teams/nba/2017/scores/gamedetail/GAMEID_gamedetail.json
where [GAMEID] is the gameid number
example:
https://data.nba.com/data/10s/v2015/json/mobile_teams/nba/2017/scores/gamedetail/0021700965_gamedetail.json
- there are CORS restrictions, seems to need some sort of browser session token (or maybe TCP kept alive) to retrieve with cross origin.
- For instance, a tested example. Tried accessing link using XHTTP/AJAX on different site but access is not allowed, however if open the game boxscore in corresponding stats.nba.com/game/GAMEID page, then try AJAX on other site to access, will retrieve the data. 
- Browser sessions separate results, e.g. incognito from regular session. Would have to repeat process by opening stats.nba page in the session and then making the XHTTP call afterwards.
- Access or connection seems to have a time restricted period, times out after ~10 minutes, before restricting access again? (possibly erroneous. Further testing suggest it is related to activity or maintaining focus on the tab/window with the nba.stats.com game page)
- However, clicking or focus on the stats.nba game page (no refresh necessary either) will allow cross origin XHTTP calls again, for unspecified amount of time (inconsistent, but seems to keep alive as long as window is focused, or the game tab is selected/focused on non-focused browser window)
- Overall using this link through cross origin XHTTP AJAX seems non-viable due to restrictions
- same is true for other links in data.nba.net (example: https://data.nba.net/prod/v1/20180307/0021700969_boxscore.json)
